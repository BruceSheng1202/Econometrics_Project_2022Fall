# Econmetrics_Project_2022Fall
This is the project detail in the course Econometrics taught by Ying Fang in Xiamen University. In this project, I read Professor Hsiao's article [A PANEL DATA APPROACH FOR PROGRAM EVALUATION: MEASURING THE BENEFITS OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION OF HONG KONG WITH MAINLAND CHINA](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jae.1230) carefully and tried to reproduce the result by using R language programming. This was a naive attempt but an important experience that made me fall in love with econometrics and causal inference.

## An Improved Version from DevEcon_Project_2023Spring
In the spring of 2023 I referenced Hollingsworth's article [Tactics for design and inference in synthetic control studies: An applied example using high-dimensional data](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fc9xt/) and changed it into a synthetic control method using ElasticNet penalties, coding by R, for the sake of dealing with overfitting and collinearity in high-dimensional time series data. 

The motivation came from my point of view that there are some unfair and unreasonable factors in former research. Firstly, the 1st assumption of Synthetic Control is that the policy treatment should have no inluences on other districts. But (Hsiao et.al, 2012) use Taiwan as a donor, which violated this assumption. Secondly, the donors used in former research are few and limited in Pacific-Asian Area. However, there should be some countries and regions similar to Hongkong as a former island colony, which might be good donors in regression. Lastly, the announcement declaring that British government would return the sovereignty of Hong Kong to China was in 1984, after which the policies in Hongkong had been changed a lot from the former. So it's better to take 1984 as a treatment year.

With reference to Hollingsworth (2022), I determine the optimal parameters by rolling cross-validation and grid searching. This improved version was the project in my another course Issues in Development Economics taught by Huang Chen in Xiamen University. The essay was written by Chinese and praised by Dr.Chen. The conclusion is consistent with the results of Hsiao (2012) that Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997 has no significant impact on Hong Kong’s GDP. However, I am still unpleasant about this research for insufficient validation in methodology.

In 2023Fall, I would try some other bether methods and improve it again.
