# Econmetrics_Project_2022Fall
This is the project detail in the course Econometrics taught by Ying Fang in Xiamen University. In this project, I read Professor Hsiao's article <A PANEL DATA APPROACH FOR PROGRAM EVALUATION: MEASURING THE BENEFITS OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION OF HONG KONG WITH MAINLAND CHINA> carefully and tried to reproduce the result by using R language programming.
